RUNNING PiMS ON TOMCAT 7 AND LATER

You can stop Tomcat by entering:
    /etc/init.d/tomcat stop
This usually works, but not always. To check whether it has worked:
    ps ax | grep tomcat
This should list only one process, running the command itself.
If it lists another, that is the tomcat process. You should 
carefully copy its process number into a "kill -9" command.

You can start tomcat by entering:
    /etc/init.d/tomcat start
    
We do not recommend using Tomcat's web interface to deploy PiMS.
For Tomcat7, it does not work well to indicate a war file in the docbase. 
Instead, unpack pims.war by:
    mkdir pims
    cd pims
    jar xf ../pims.war
 Then make a pims.xml with the docbase pointing to this folder.

The traditional configuration of Tomcat put all the components in a single directory,
and put the location of that directory in the environment variable CATALINA_HOME.
Most distributions now use a lot of soft links. 
Here are some directories that parts of the installation may be in:
    /srv/tomcat7
    /var/cache/tomcat7
    /etc/tomcat7

It is better to set autoDeploy="false" in the Host element in:
    $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml
This avoids unexpected behaviour when the machine is rebooted.

Note that Tomcat7 will delete your context file when the war is updated. You should keep a copy in e.g:
    $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/pims.xml.backup
It is suggested that when you upgrade PiMS you use a new path for the new war file.

The tools that PIMS uses can fill up Java's "Permanent Generation" of memory.
To prevent this, before starting Tomcat specify:

export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -enableassertions -server -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -Djava.awt.headless=true"

Alternatively, you can edit this into tomcat6.conf. This file is usually at /etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf.

Tomcat has a memory leak where large JSP page requests can fill up memory. 
To avoid this, create $CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh and set:

export CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -Dorg.apache.jasper.runtime.BodyContentImpl.LIMIT_BUFFER=true"

or on Windows, edit bin\setenv.bat and set:

set CATALINA_OPTS=%CATALINA_OPTS% -Dorg.apache.jasper.runtime.BodyContentImpl.LIMIT_BUFFER=true

When you install a new release of PiMS, Tomcat keeps files from
the previous release. You also need to:
    rm -rf $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/pims
There is also a work directory that must be deleted, e.g.:
    rm -rf $CATALINA_HOME/work/Catalina/localhost/pims
or in some distros:
    /var/cache/tomcat6/Catalina/localhost/pims/ 
    
Tomcat nicely rolls its own log files, but messages from PiMS all go into the file
    ${CATALINA_HOME}/logs/catalina.out
    
 The simplest way to ensure this rolls is to add to your crontab something like: 
00 03 * * * cp /usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.18/logs/catalina.out /usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.18/logs/console-`date +%Y-%m-%d`.out

You can speed up the page load for your users by editing conf/server.xml
to replace the <Connector> element with:
    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" 
               connectionTimeout="20000" 
               compressableMimeType="text/html,text/xml,text/plain,text/javascript,text/css,application/javascript,application/x-javascript"
               compression="2048"
               noCompressionUserAgents="gozilla, traviata"
               redirectPort="8443" />
