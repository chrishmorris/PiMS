USING SCORE PARAMETERS IN PROTOCOLS

PiMS supports scoring of experiments, by means of specially-named protocol parameters. It also
allows you to associate colours and icons with those scores, making it very easy to get an
overview of a plate experiment's success (or otherwise).

Because these score parameters are defined at the protocol level, you can have a different scoring
system for each stage of your pipeline - even for different ways of doing the same stage, if you
feel the need.

Future versions of PiMS will have a better user interface for making score parameters, as well as 
the ability to optimise from several parallel plate experiments based on scores.

Until this improved interface is available, please follow this guide to creating score parameters 
on your protocols. Note that each protocol may have at most one score parameter.

----

Create a new text parameter.

----


In the "Name" field, enter a name beginning with two underscore characters. This name must contain 
no spaces or other punctuation, and the first character after the underscores must be a letter, not
a number. For example:

__score
__expressionScore

----

In the "Description" field, enter the name that you want to be shown to the user, e.g.,

Score
Expression score

----


In "Default value", enter:

unscored

----


In "Possible values", enter "unscored" and each possible score, in order from worst
to best, separated by semicolons. For example:

unscored;No;Maybe;Yes
unscored;Terrible;Bad;Average;OK;Great

NB The order is CRITICAL - this is the only way PiMS can know that "OK" is better than
   "Terrible" when doing automated tasks that are based on the score.

----


Specify the options at the bottom of the form as follows:


Must a value always be entered for this parameter?
Yes

Is this a result parameter?
Yes

Is this a group level parameter?
No 

----

If you want to associate colours and icons with the new score parameter, this is done by editing
CSS and by creating icons. 

PiMS ships with CSS and icons already made for a parameter called __score, with three values 
(e.g., "No", "Maybe", "Yes"). Use this as an example for setting up your own scoring system.


ICONS

Icons for scores should be placed in this directory:

/skins/default/images/icons/scores/

They should be 16x16 pixels or less (not too much less!), and ideally in PNG format. We recommend that 
the icons have a transparent background, to allow any colours you associate with the score to show through.

The name of the icons should be the name of the parameter (minus the leading underscores), followed by a
number. For "unscored", this number is zero - in practice, you may not have an icon for "unscored". For 
the next icon (which should be for the worst score, remembering that scores are ordered worst to best),
this number is 1; the next-worst is 2, and so on. Lastly, the appropriate extension for the file type -
we recommend PNG images, so ".png".

Example: For a parameter called __expressionScore, with "unscored", "None", "Poor", "OK", and "Fantastic":

expressionScore0.png - unscored (you probably don't want to bother with an icon)
expressionScore1.png - None (maybe a very grumpy face)
expressionScore2.png - Poor (sad face)
expressionScore3.png - OK (happy face)
expressionScore4.png - Fantastic (very happy face)


CSS

For your icons to show up in a plate experiment, you need to add some CSS rules to PiMS. At the same time, you
can also specify background colours to further highlight the scores.

There is a stylesheet dedicated to scores, located at:

/skins/default/css/plates/scores.dcss

CSS classes are already defined for the default "__score" parameter, as follows. You may want to cut/paste this
and edit the copy for your new score:

.score0 {  } /* unscored, no style */
.score1 { background-image:url(${pageContext.request.contextPath}/skins/default/images/icons/scores/score1.png); background-color:#f99; }
.score2 { background-image:url(${pageContext.request.contextPath}/skins/default/images/icons/scores/score2.png); background-color:#ff9; }
.score3 { background-image:url(${pageContext.request.contextPath}/skins/default/images/icons/scores/score3.png); background-color:#9f9; }

Create a CSS class for each score. The name of the class should be the name of the parameter, with
the double underscore removed, followed by a number. For the first, which should be "unscored",
this is zero. The number increases by one with each subsequent score - remember that scores should
be ordered worst-first.
