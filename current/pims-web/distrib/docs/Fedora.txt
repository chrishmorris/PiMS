SOME HINTS FOR INSTALLING ON FEDORA

PiMS is tested on SUSE Linux, so you are most likely to get a good result 
on that platform. If you prefer to use Fedora, here are some notes
that may help with the installation process.

POSTGRESQL
You will need to edit
   /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
   
JAVA AND TOMCAT
Fedora installs the GNU Java implementation, gcj. PiMS is not tested on gcj.
We recommend uninstalling that by:
    yum list | grep gcj | xargs yum remove    

We advise installing and using Sun Java, 
specifically the HotSpot Server JVM. You need the whole JDK, not just the JRE. 
Note that to change the JVM used by Tomcat you must edit both of:
    /etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf
    /etc/sysconfig/tomcat6
    
You can find some helpful detailed instructions at the following sites:

Ant also uses the gij java complier so you will also need to edit:
/etc/ant.conf
by specifying the JAVA_HOME
 JAVA_HOME=/path to java
 e.g. JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.7.9
 
 UPGRADING TO A NEW VERSION OF PIMS
 Whenyou update a PiMS installation, you may have to run some Java programs that we supply to update the schema of your database. 
 If the command "java" invokes gij, then these jobs may fail, with messages like:
     java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.management.ObjectName
     
 In that case, you should run them again, specifying the path to your installation
 of Sun Java.
