In order to allow connections to postgresql, 
you must not only create the database user, 
you must also ensure there is an appropriate entry in a file called pg_hba.conf.
On Windows is it at: 
   C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\8.1\data\pg_hba.conf
On other Linux systems it can be at a variety of places e.g.
On most redhat systems, it is at:
    /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
On A SUSE system it is often at:
    /home/pgsql/data
You can find the directory it is in by reading the output of:
   ps ax | grep sql

A simple way to check that PiMS will be able to connect to the database
it is to type on the command line:
   psql -d test -h ::1 -U pimsupdate
The "-h ::1" specifies an IPv6 connection - Java applications including PiMS
will use IPv6 if it is available. 

The simplest way to allow PiMS to connect is:

# IPv4 local connections:
    host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          md5

On Linux, it is simpler to add:
    # IPv6 local connections:
    host    all         all         ::1/128               md5
since PiMS uses a Java connection, which defaults to IPv6 if that is available.
However, if you add this line for a Windows machine which does not have IPv6,
then Postgres will not start.

If you decide to run the database on a different machine to Tomcat,
you must make an appropriate entry in pg_hba.conf. 
You will also have to edit postgresql.conf to add
    listen_addresses='*'
or the IP address for the database server (NOT for the web server).

Only one of these are required, but it isn't always easy to find out which.

If you are running untrusted code on the same machine you may prefer:

host    pims         pimsupdate         127.0.0.1/32          md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host    pims         pimsupdate         ::1/128               md5

Then stop and restart postgresql. The safe way to do this is:
    sudo sudo -u postgres pg_ctl -m fast -D /var/lib/pgsql/data restart
    
PiMS is not a CPU intensive application, so it is satisfactory
to run Tomcat and Postgresql on the same machine. 
    
BACKUP

You should periodically, e.g. every night:
    vacuumdb --analyze -d pims -U postgres
    pg_dump --format=c --no-owner -U postgres -f /backup/pims.sql pims 
    tar -czf /backup/pimsUploads.tar.gz /var/pims/pimsUploads 
It is not necessary to stop PiMS to run these commands.   

You can restore your backup by:
    dropdb -U postgres pims
    createdb -U postgres --encoding UTF-8 pims
    pg_restore  -U postgres --disable-triggers -d pims /backup/pims.sql 

TIME ZONE

When PiMS uses times, it specifies the time zone, so it does not matter what time zone the database expects as default.
