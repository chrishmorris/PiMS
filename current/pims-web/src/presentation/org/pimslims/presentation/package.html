<h1>Presentation model for PIMS.</h1>
<p>
This package contains classes that act as a 
<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html">Presentation Model</a>
for parts of the PiMS data model. Their function is to 
"represent the state and behavior of the presentation independently of the GUI controls used in the interface...
It's useful for allowing you to test without the UI, support for some form of multiple view 
and a separation of concerns which may make it easier to develop the user interface.
" (Martin Fowler). </p>
