List of changes.
================================================================================
Core changes (to be implemented next week 18-22 August 2008).
Focus on 01 to 08 first: simplification of implementation package, deletion of Project, renaming of MemopsBaseClass into BaseClass and creation of name and details properties in BaseClass and removing them from subclasses.

Package.
-01- rename implementation to core
-02- rm ApplicationData & subclasses
-03- rm ContentStored, DataLocation, Storage, NormalStorage, ContentStorage
-04- rm AbstractStorage & Project
-05- rm Url

BaseClass & LabBookEntry.
-06- rename MemopsBaseClass to BaseClass
-07- add property name & details in BaseClass
-08- rm all name & details properties in subclasses of BaseClass
-09- add link between User & LabBookEntry called author
-10- rm links Experiment.creator, Protocol.creator, DropAnnotation.annotator, ExpBlueprint.owner, Image.creator, Sample.assignTo, Target.creator, Annotation.author
-11- add link between User & LabBookEntry called lastEditor & add lastEditedDate
-12- rm Protocol.lastEditor, Protocol.lastEditedDate, Experiment.lastEditor, Experiment.lastEditedDate
-13- rm all project property in subclasses of BaseClass
-14- create LabBookEntry in core
-15- change extends BaseClass to LabBookEntry for most of the classes (except future reference classes)
-16- create AttachmentEntry with date and author property as subclass of BaseClass
-17- add one-to-many parent link between LabBookEntry and AttachementEntry.
-18- add extra methods in LabBookEntry for getAnnotations(), getNotes(), getCitations() & getExternalDbLinks() and also addAnnotation(), addNote(), addCitation() & add ExternalDbLink()

Annotation.
-19- mv Annotation to core - extends AttachmentEntry
-20- rm Annotation links to ExperimentGroup, Experiment, TargetGroup, TargetProject, Target, Protocol. Replace by link to LabBookEntry
-21- rm Annotation.date

Citation.
-22- mv Citation to core & subclasses - extends AttachmentEntry
-23- rm Citation links to Person (change to String), Method, Protocol, Software, Target. Replace by link to LabBookEntry
-24- rm in Citation attr casAbstractCode, doi, medlineUiCode, pubMedId. >>> ??? do we need these ??? <<<
-25- rm Citation.keywords

DbRef.
-26- mv DbRef to core and rename to ExternalDbLink - extends AttachmentEntry
-27- rm ExternalDbLink links to TargetGroup, Target. Replace by link to LabBookEntry

Note.
-28- create Note class with relatedEnties link to LabBookEntry - extends AttachmentEntry

Access.
-29- simplify Permission
-30- mv AccessObject link from BaseClass to LabBookEntry


Reference changes.
- create package reference
- mv DbName to reference
- rm dbRef package
- mv HolderCategory, InstrumentType, ComponentCategory, ExperimentType, HazardPhrase, SampleCategory, Scoreboard, Status (rename TargetStatus), NaturalSource into reference
- rm riskAssessment package
- rm taxonomy package
- create PublicEntry in reference
- mv WorkflowItem into reference
- rm namingSystem attribute (not normalised) in reference package
- add Classification & link to PublicEntry
- rm HazardPhrase.classification
- add Chemical in reference

Other changes.
- mv Instrument to experiment
- mv Method to experiment
- rename package refSampleComponent to Molecule
- merge AbstractComponent & MolComponent into Molecule
- rename MolCompFeature into MoleculeFeature
- rm Procedure, Step, WaitStep, TemperatureStep
- merge target & expBlueprint packages
- rename TargetProject into Project
- rm link between Milestone & ExpBlueprint

todo: holder, location, schedule & crystallization package
new model located here: https://www.pims-lims.org/svn/pims/developers/pajon/pims-model/new/

================================================================================
Team Discussion Fri 15/08/2008.
================================================================================
- Note/Annotation discussion
    - discussion on cardinality of the link between Annotation & LabBookEntry: one-to-many or many-to-many?
    - discussion on inheritance tree of Note, Citation & Annotation: investigate if could be grouped under AttachmentEntry?

================================================================================
Team Discussion Thu 14/08/2008.
================================================================================
- Finalize draft on full model with list of changes - send it around
- If changes agreed tomorrow, may implement them next week.

================================================================================
Team Discussion Wed 13/08/2008.
================================================================================
- Note/Annotation - no need to be under access control because their parents are LabBookEntry
>>> group Note & Annotation

- Citation - do we need it? problem with list of Authors that cluttered Person table
>>> now just stored as a single string

- Modification (Audit trail)/LabBookEntry
>>> add link
Each time a sample concentration is changed - how to do this?
Modification should be one record per transaction
Last edit date in LabBookEntry should be good enough for now
Look at postgresql package to have log of changes
Useful to know who's done what - so need maybe more than postgresql log
To keep track of changes in Protocol or Experiment
Maybe useful to have something like subversion in future for PiMS in order to go back to last week stage

- External database link
>>> rename to ExternalDbLink

- PublicEntry is fine but should be used carefully
>>> put DbName, Chemicals, SampleCategory, ExperimentType,...

New diagrams needed
- Experiment Group
>>> Simple experiment is a group experiment of one. Link protocol to experiment group

- Full model included draft proposed changes to see impact

- Customization - storing home page & history
>>> deferred to next code camp

================================================================================
Team Discussion Tue 12/08/2008.
================================================================================
- Person/User
>>> replace Person by User

- Note should not subclass BaseClass

- Image can inherit from Attachment or maybe group them together

- Access control lonked to LabBookEntry

- ToDo - not needed yet

More drawings needed


Changes.
Associate file
- add a many-to-many link between Annotation to current MemopsBaseClass and remove current links to individual classes Target, TargetProject, TargetGroup, Experiment, ExperimentGroup and Protocol.

Citation
- having Citation that extends Annotation (File, DbRef, Text extends Annotation)

Annotation
- make Citation and DbRef subclasses of Annotation (Annotation can be free text, file, citation, or external database)

Target
- remove link between Milestone and ExpBlueprint and create an helper method getMilestones in ExpBlueprint

Reference data
- remove namingSystem attribute in all type/category classes as it is not normalized (in packages: Holder, Instrument, Protocol, SampleComponent, Sample, Target)

Application Data

Access Control
- remove current attributes permissionClass, opType, roleName and permission
- add boolean attributes create, read, update and delete

Implementation/core
- remove in org.pimslims.model.implementation NormalStorage, Storage, AbstractStorage, ContentStore, ContentStorage, DataLocation
- remove org.pimslims.model.implementation.Project [never being used - always being set to ChemComp!]
- rename MemopsBaseClass into BaseClass
- add LabEntry and PublicEntry as subclasses of BaseClass
- add attributes description, details and createDate in LabEntry
- remove attributes description, details and createDate in subclasses of LabEntry
- add links from LabEntry to Annotation (many-to-many) and Person (many-to-one for creator)
