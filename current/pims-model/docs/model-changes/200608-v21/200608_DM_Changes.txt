Changes to package ccp.Experiment:
- Added attribute name to Experiment
- Removed role linking Experiment and ccp.Sample.Sample
- Added attribute name to InputSample
- Altered multiplicity of role linking InputSample and ccp.Sample.Sample from *-1 to *-[0..1]
  + Allows InputSample to be created before actual Sample is known
- Added *-[0..1] role linking InputSample and new class ccp.Protocol.RefInputSample
- Added new class OutputSample
  + Has class Experiment as parent
  + [0..1]-[0..1] link with class ccp.Sample.Sample
  + *-[0..1] link with new class ccp.Protocol.RefOutputSample
  + Records how much of the referenced sample came out of the experiment
  + Note that experiment.getOutputSamples() now returns a list of members of this class
- Altered multiplicity of role linking Parameter and ccp.Protocol.ParameterDefinition from *-1 to *-[0..1]
  + Allows Parameter to be created without ccp.Protocol.ProtocolDefinition
- Added attributes unit, name and paramType to Parameter to allow use without ccp.Protocol.ParameterDefinition


Changes to package ccp.Protocol:
- Added attribute mandatory to ParameterDefinition
- Removed role linking Protocol with ccp.Sample.SampleCategory
- Added new class RefInputSample
  + Has class Protocol as Parent
  + *-[0..1] role linking RefInputSample with class Step
  + [0..1]-* role linking RefInputSample with class ccp.Experiment.InputSample
  + *-[0..1] role linking RefInputSample with class ccp.Sample.RefSample
  + Use instead of the Material class
- Added new class RefOutputSample
  + Has class Protocol as Parent
  + *-[0..1] role linking RefOutputSample with class Step
  + [0..1]-* role linking RefOutputSample with class ccp.Experiment.OutputSample
  + *-[0..1] role linking RefOutputSample with class ccp.Sample.RefSample


Changes to package ccp.Sample:
- Renamed conformsTo/conforming role linking Sample with RefSample back to default
  + refSample = sample.conformsTo() => refSample = sample.getRefSample()
  + samples = refSample.conforming() => samples = refSample.getSamples()
- Renamed experimentInputs role linking Sample with InputSample back to default
  + inputSamples = sample.experimentInputs() => inputSamples = sample.getInputSamples()
- Updated code associated with getCreationDate() operation to reflect changed links 
- Affected by changes to ccp.Experiment package
  + Removed role linking Sample with ccp.Experiment.Experiment
  + Added [0..1]-* role linking Sample with new class ccp.Experiment.InputSample
  + Added [0..1]-[0..1] role linking Sample with new class ccp.Experiment.OutputSample
- Affected by changes to ccp.Protocol package
  + Removed role linking SampleCategory with ccp.Protocol.Protocol
  + Added [0..1]-* role linking RefSample with class ccp.Protocol.RefInputSample
  + Added [0..1]-* role linking RefSample with class ccp.Protocol.RefOutputSample


Updated all model diagrams from Experiment, Protocol and Sample packages
