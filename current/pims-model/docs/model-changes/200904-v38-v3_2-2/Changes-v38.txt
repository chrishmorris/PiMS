--------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
IMPLEMENTED (x) DEFERED (>)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
x PIMS-2535   Naming System in Target Groups  
  > removed attribute namingSystem
  
x PIMS-2492   Should Why Chosen be mandatory in New Complex   
  > changed ResearchObjectiveElement.whyChoosen to non mandatory
  
x PIMS-2545   Can not attach a researchobjective to a complex if why chosen is null         
  > duplicate of PIMS-2492
  
x PIMS-2519   Protein name should be derived attribute of Target      
  > added derived attribute getProteinName()
  
x PIMS-2029   Organism Name need not be unique        
  > added OrganismTester
  
x PIMS-2746   Primer.lengthOnGene should be int
  > changed attribute type from String to Integer
  
x PIMS-2772   Attributes of target group look odd
  > removed attribute completeName
  > renamed attribute shortName to name and changed constraint
  
x PIMS-2775  Odd constructor for org.pimslims.model.molecule.Construct
  > deprecated odd constructor and added new more appropriate one

x PIMS-2764  Recording Host Strains
  > added Host class (subclass of AbstractComponent)

x remove all namingSystem in comments
x fixe misspell "contraint" replace by "constraint"

x PIMS-2788  New class for recording Extensions
  > add Extension class (subclass of Molecule)

x PIMS-466    Plate type must have supplier   
  > add HolderTypeSource between AbstractHolderType and Organisation called supplier in reference pkg
  > rise new issue (PIMS-): link between RefSampleSource and RefHolder is inadequate (RefSampleSource cannot be used for RefSample AND RefHolder). Is a link between RefHolder and Organisation needed? 

x PIMS-2145   Improve documentation of Sample       
  > add extra documentation in class for crystallization trial plates
  
x PIMS-2728   Need to record the target and the Construct on Experiment view
  > send back to Susy for clarification
  > assign to Marc
  
x PIMS-1506  Order of Input Samples
  > change role name from experiment.Experiment.sampleIos to inputSamples 
  > change Set to List for experiment.Experiment.inputSamples with an extra order_ column 

x PIMS-2144   Link modification between Target & DbRef  
  > add new class SimilarityHit between Target and ExternalDbLink - one way link only for the moment

x PIMS-2811  UserGroup.members should be dropped
  > remove UserGroup.members and User.legGroups
  > rename UserGroup.leaders to memberUsers
  
x PIMS-2788  New class for recording Extensions
  > add extra attribute isForUse

> PIMS-2198   Can we have fields possibly in the Person class to represent account numbers or project codes for which this person has singing powers       
  > send back to Peter for clarification
  > for future

> PIMS-1873   ERD diagrams        
  > send back to Chris for clarification
  > for Alan for 3.3

x PIMS-2126   the result/SetupDefinitions of protocol need improvement and DM change       
  > Already fixed
  
x PIMS-2124  Parameter definitions should be listed in Experiments in the order they appear in the Protocol
  > Already fixed

x PIMS-768    High cardinality links must be one way
  > remove ComponentCategory.components & add derived method getComponents() based on findAll
  > remove InstrumentType.instrument & add derived method getInstruments() based on findAll
  (> remove HolderType.holderTypePositions & add derived method getHolderTypePositions() based on findAll
  (> not sure of this one - need to check with Bill)
  > remove SampleCategory.refInputSamples & add derived method getRefInputSamples() based on findAll
  > remove SampleCategory.refOutputSamples & add derived method getRefOutputSamples() based on findAll
  > remove Molecule.researchObjectiveElements & add derived method getResearchObjectiveElements() based on findAll
  > remove Molecule.relatedResearchObjectiveElements & add derived method getRelatedResearchObjectiveElements() based on findAll
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
- PIMS-2807 Link between RefSampleSource and RefHolder is inappropriate
  > remove link between RefSample and RefHolder
  > add new RefHolderSource class in holder package to link RefHolder and Organisation

UNIQUENESS CONSTRAINTS
- PIMS-660    unique constrain in DB needs review
- PIMS-2547   Uniqueness constraint failure sometimes badly reported    
- PIMS-2675   Uniqueness constraints lead to information leakage     
SCALABILITY
HISTORY
- PIMS-1101   persistent MRU
PLATE EXPERIMENTS
- PIMS-625    Plate experiment - setting some parameters do not make sense in the context of individual well, but a whole plate      
PROTOCOL
- PIMS-2551   Parameter definition of type "File"      
- PIMS-2553   Parameter definition of type "External Link"    
- PIMS-2636   Protocols should be marked as production / QA / recovery      
PERSON
- PIMS-2527   Merge Person and User    
TARGET
- PIMS-2101   No history item for a Complex but construct icon for 'generic' view       

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
AGREED
- PIMS-625 Plate experiment - setting some parameters do not make sense in the context of individual well, but a whole plate
>>> add extra GroupParameter class linked to ExperimentGroup and linked to ParameterDefinition where isGroupLevel is set to true
>>> add documentation on ExperimentGroup - must contain experiments with same protocol

UNDER DISCUSSION
- PIMS-1101 persistent MRU
==> Anne and Bill to correspond. Add extra class with no reference to others, just list of hooks per user. Bill to provide current design.

- PIMS-768 High cardinality links must be one way
>>> Links to Type and Category need to be changed to one-way links. Need to make the list.
==> Bill and Jon to decide how to implement the change. Chris to prepare initial list of links affected by this. Anne to provide latest diagrams.

- PIMS-660 unique constrain in DB needs review
>>> add uniqueness key constraint on attribute name for all subclasses of MemopsBaseClass except those that are involved in a parent/child (black diamond on UML class diagrams) relationship, then their unique key will be (parentId, name).

- PIMS-1515 Cant create Targets from two different organisms with the same protein name
>>> MolComponent name is changeable but should be unique
==> Could we use synonyms?
