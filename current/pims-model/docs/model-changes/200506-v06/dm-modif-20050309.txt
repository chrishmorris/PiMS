questions & remarks: 

- The risk and safety phrases should be split on comma.

- In AbstractSample, do we need all theses attributes related to risk and safety issues: isHazard, localRiskNum, msdsSafetyDetails and safetyDetails ? If yes, which type should they have?

- In RiskSafety class, do we want to store only the code or do we want also to store the phrase associated to it(attribute phraseDetails)?

- Is RefSample.sampleType(s) a multiple or single attribute? What is the cardinality of this attribute: 0..1, 1, * or 1..*? Should the proposed values be an open enumerated list or a closed one? If it is a closed one, there is no way of extended it except by changing the data model.

- In AbstractComponent class, do you think that it is a good idea to have be a componentType attribute and a componentRoles one? 

- The AbstractComponent.componentType is used to define the type of the component, the possible values are {Protein, DNA, RNA, Other Polymer, DNA/RNA, Non Polymer}. I think this attribute is a mandatory attribute of cardinality 1. Do you agree? Should the possible values be an open enumerated list or a closed one?

- The AbstractComponent.componentRoles attribute is used to categorise the component, the possible values are listed before. I think this attribute should not be mandatory and it is a multiple attribute because a component can have many different roles. This attribute is mainly here to help to display the list of AbstractComponent available by role, even if this classification depends on lab, I think it is better to have it to help to display them. And we can try to propose a "pims" way of grouping AbstractComponent by roles. Do you agree? Should the possible values be an open enumerated list or a closed one?

- What is CSI in AbstractComponent.componentRoles?

- In Construct, can we replace the attribute function to componentRoles? If yes, what is the list of the possible value?

- Do we need a specific list of values for Cell.componentRoles: Competent Cell? 

- Are there specific componentRoles for MolComponent, RestrictionEnzyme, Primer, Construct, Cell, Substance and Composite? or can the list for AbstractComponent.componentRoles be used for all of them?
