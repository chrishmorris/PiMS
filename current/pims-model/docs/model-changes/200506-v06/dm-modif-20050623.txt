Dear All,

After weeks of collecting the emails from the data-model-change mailing list, here is a summary of the different issues that were raised and some propositions to solve them. It took me quite a long time to go through all the requests, I hope to take less time to effectively incorporate them into the data model as soon as we reach agreement. So now I am waiting your contribution again in order to know what are your opinions on these changes. Thanks a lot in advance for your involvement.

I classified the changes by package, the current data model documentation is available here: http://www.pims-lims.org/svn/pims/datamodel/model/doc/index.html.

Here is the summary of my questions, you can find them in the text below:
-01- If we do that, it still means that each time there is going to be an enzyme in a sample, there will be anyway the need to create a MolComponent. Would you really want to do that?  
-02- If the separation between Target and Molecule class are not good enough, can someone suggest something better, please?
-03- There are 2 options: (1) new attribute usedInExpTypes in RefInstrument or/and (2) a many-to-may link between RefInstrument & Protocol. What do you think?
-04- Do you think this new StockTracking package is going to be useful and will solve the problems we are facing?
-05- Could you check if all the required attributes are in Protocol.ParameterDefinition & Experiment.Parameter?
-06- Do you mean that Protocol.DialysisStep.[bufferVolume, bufferVolDisplayUnit & bufferChanges] attributes should also be added to Protocol.WaitStep?
-07- Do we really want to store 4 lines for the address or a multiple line field would work?
-08- Can Rasmus give us more explanation of what Citation.isPrimary is? For instance, if Peter adds citation for the Target and think that this Citation is the most important one (the primary source of information on this Target) does he need to make it isPrimary=yes? 
-09- I am in favour of storing the values of such lists in the database. What do you think?
-10- Target.Target: there is a request to be able to record if a Target is an orthologue or paralogue of another. Would a one-to-many link on Target would solve the problem? Is there a generic way to give a name to this link: referTo, orthologueTo or paralogueTo?
-11- Workflow: How to link protocol together in order to build a workflow?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Molecule package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: new attr in Molecule class
	+ extinctionCoeff: Float (Unit M-1 cm-1)
	definition: The molar extinction coefficient is a measure of the amount of light absorbed by a 1M solution in a pathlength of 1cm at a given wavelength. For a protein, this can be estimated from a knowledge of its amino acid composition.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Annotation package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: Rename MolFeature (linked to Molecule.MolResidue) to MolResFeature

:: Move RefSampleComponent.MolCompFeature to Annotation.MolFeature and create a link to Molecule.Molecule that can then be used to describe features of the Target in this way and remove the link to RefSampleComponent.MolComponent.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- RefSampleComponent package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: Separating Biological/Chemical data in the data model
It seems that the concensus is that it is incorrect to inherit RestrictionEnzime, Construct, and Primer from the MolComponent. So it means that it would be better to have RestrictionEnzime, Construct, and Primer as separate classes in a separate package, with a link to MolComponent. In that way, RefSampleComponent would contain only  information relevant for the composition of samples, but not for particular scientific fields.

-01- If we do that, it still means that each time there is going to be an enzyme in a sample, there will be anyway the need to create a MolComponent. Would you really want to do that?  

:: Classes definition
RefSampleComponent.AbstractComponent
NEW: The abstract component is used to define the details which characterise all components, these are a name, any synonyms and a CASnumber. There are 4 subclasses of  abstract component in PIMS: Molecular Component (MolComponent), Cell, Substance and Composite.
CURRENT: The abstract component that is used as a reference can be involved in several sample components. The abstract component is context specific inside a lab. There are  4 subclasses of abstract component. Molecular Component (MolComponent), Cell, Substance and Composite

RefSampleComponent.MolComponent
NEW: One type of component defined in PIMS. A Molecular component (MolComponent) represents a pure component of known molecular structure. This includes most chemicals,  proteins, DNA, RNA, DNA/RNA and also enzymes, constructs and primers. Restriction Enzymes, Primers and Constructs are subtypes of MolComponents with additional features  recorded in PIMS. NaCl is a MolComponent, so is lysozyme.
CURRENT: This is one of the abstract component. The abstract MolComponent is defined by the lab context and represents a pure component. Everything with a chemical  structure should be of type MolComponent.

RefSampleComponent.Construct
NEW: This is a subtype of MolComponent. It is used to summarise information about a construct such as an expression vector plasmid.
CURRENT: This is a subtype of MolComponent. It is used to summarise information about polymer construct like expression vector or expression plasmid.

RefSampleComponent.Construct.function
NEW: The Construct class is also used to describe vectors and so the 'function' can be used to indicate the function of the vector e.g. expression.
CURRENT: The primary function of the construct. This should be considered as a guideline only.

RefSampleComponent.RestrictionEnzyme
NEW: This is a subtype of MolComponent. Restriction enzymes are known to cleave nucleic acid sequences at certain positions.

RefSampleComponent.Primer
NEW: This is a subtype of MolComponent. A specific oligonucleotide or primer such as a PCR-primer used to amplify nucleic acid fragments.
CURRENT: This is a subtype of MolComponent. A specific oligonucleotide or a specific primer used to amplify nucleic acid fragments.

RefSampleComponent.Substance
NEW: A substance should be limited to cases that cannot be described by the other subtypes of MolComponent. Typically: bovine calf serum, light petroleum, wheat germ extract, algal hydrolysate.
CURRENT: This is one of the abstract component. This is a component where no detailed chemical structure is provided (e.g. salt, phosphate,...). This is a simple way to  describe not only complex mixtures but also components for which you do not want to create a molecule.

RefSampleComponent.Composite
NEW: Composite is a subclass of AbstractComponent. It is a non-covalent complex of any kind. E.g.: A DNA duplex, a micelle, possibly containing other molecules. A protein  with an inhibitor bound. A cell containing plasmids.
CURRENT: This is one of the abstract component: the composite component. That describes a group of components with specific association as enzyme and substrat or complex  members or oligomers.

RefSampleComponent.Cell
NEW: Cell is a subclass of AbstractComponent.  It is used to describe the chracteristics of a eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell.
CURRENT: This is one of the abstract component. The information on the cell component.

RefSampleComponent.ComponentDbRef
NEW: The link between a database reference (DbRef) and a component in PIMS.
CURRENT: The link between the database reference and the abstract component.

RefSampleComponent.ComponentCategory
NEW: The category of the component as classified by a namingSystem. Different organisations can have their own categories. PIMS default categories include buffering agent,  salt, inhibitor....
CURRENT: The category of the component classified by namingSystem. Different organisations can have their own categories.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Target package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea here was indeed to handle targets and proteins separately. But, you have to store the protein sequence of the target by creating a Molecule (protein). And in fact, Target.seqString is a derived attribute from the mandatory link to Molecule. It is not stored in the Target class.

-02- If the separation between Target and Molecule class are not good enough, can someone suggest something better, please?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- DbRef package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: Classes definition
DbRef.DbRef
NEW: The information on a database reference. This is a reference to an element in an outside database.
CURRENT: The information on the database reference. This is a reference to an element in an outside database.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Instrument package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It seems that the consensus is that items of small consumable equipment should be treated as instruments.
To monitor the number of units and their use, I propose to create a new StockTraking package (see below).
For reagents, 'purchasing' involves Experiment.ImportSample, because we need something similar for instruments, I suggest that can be handle by a generic ImportItem class.

:: Rename Instrument RefIntrument

:: New Instrument class
	+ code = code or barcode specific to a consumable equipement

:: select a Instrument capable of running a particular protocol.
-03- There are 2 options: (1) new attribute usedInExpTypes in RefInstrument or/and (2) a many-to-may link between RefInstrument & Protocol. What do you think?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- StockTracking package                                 ** diagrams attached ** 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation of a stock tracking system via a usage count. This can be applied to track the stock of consumable equipment (Instrument), lab ware (Container, Holder, ...)  and Sample. Please have a look at the diagrams attached (200506-ItemTracking-details.gif & 200506-ItemTrackingRef-details.gif).

On receiving a new group of 100 identical items, you set purchasedNum to 100. On using an item you increase usedNum by one. On giving twenty to the lab next door you  decrease currentNum by 20. These attributes would also be useful for tracking how many times an item can be used before it needs recalibrating/washing/poking with a stick. 


:: RefItem
	+ catalogNum
	+ dataPageUrl
	+ description
	+ maxUsageNum = maximum number of times this instrument can be used (default = 1).

:: Item
	+ purchasedNum
	+ currentNum = equal to purchasedNum at the beginning.
	+ usedNum = number of times this instrument has been used.
	+ availabilityNum = (currentNum x maxUsageNum) - usedNum

:: ImportItem
	+ dateOfImport

-04- Do you think this new StockTracking package is going to be useful and will solve the problems we are facing?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Sample package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: Remove RefSampleSource: replaced by RefItem in StockTracking package.

:: Change the cardinality of the link between Sample and SampleLocation, the location should be a mandatory. The default location should really be configurable on a  per-user basis - someone working in Goods In or Stores would have a different requirement to someone working in the lab.

:: AbstractSample.pH: Add constraint between 0 and 14

:: Classes definition
Sample.AbstractSample
NEW: General information on the sample or reagent.
CURRENT: General information on the sample.

Sample.RefSample
NEW: Reference data to which a 'real' reagent conforms. This is a means to store details which are shared by instances of the same reagent but are supplier and batch  independent
CURRENT: The information on the sample that is used to describe the Material used for a protocol.

Sample.RefSampleSource
NEW: Defines examples of supplier details for this particular reagent to allow a link to be created to the product data page
CURRENT: Information to define the RefSample from a particular supplier. The catalogue number and url for the product data page.

Sample.Sample
NEW: The information on the reagent or sample. The reagent conforms to a particular Reagent reference information. The sample is the container that has been used during an  experiment that contains the sample components.
CURRENT: The information on the sample or reagent. The sample is the container that has been used during an experiment that contains the sample components. The reagent  conforms to a particular RefSample

Sample.SampleComponent
NEW: The information on the reagent or sample component. One component is one element of the contents of the sample or reagent.
CURRENT: The information on the sample component. One sample component is one element of the contents of the sample.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- RefContainer package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: New RefLabWare class involved in the link with RefItem
	+ name
	+ labWareType
	+ capacity = number of subunits or volume
	+ details

:: Remove AbstractRefContainer, RefContainer, AbstractRefHolder & RefHolder

:: Rename RefCrystalContainer to RefCrystalHolder


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Experiment package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: Remove all subclasses of Experiment, they are now handle with Protocol.Protocol / Protocol.ParameterDefinition / Experiment.Parameter.

:: Parameter (add attr)
	+ displayUnit: Word

-05- Could you check if all the required attributes are in Protocol.ParameterDefinition & Experiment.Parameter?

:: in Experiment class
	+ endDate is mandatory – can’t use status ‘In process’ so I will change it to a non mandatory attr

:: answers
- is link attribute ‘Method’ for instruments?
Yes, there is a link between Instrument and Method to record the way for example a Instrument is loaded.

- what is sampleIos – deprecated?
Yes it is deprecated. There is no need for a SampleIo class because all the output sample belong only to one experiment. For the input one, you need a special class  InputSample to specify the sample quantity used by an experiment. There are three classes involved: Experiment.Experiment, Experiment.InputSample and Sample.Sample.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Protocol package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: ParameterDefinition (added new attr)
	+ phraseList: List = control vocabulary, available possible values
	+ defaultValue: Word

:: Need of extra steps in the Protocol package:

(1) To allow recording of a dialysis experiment.
Similar to FiltrationStep, perhaps this could just be re-named FiltrationOrDialysisStep?

DialysisStep
	+temperature: Float
	+tempDisplayUnit: Word
	+membraneName: Line
	+membraneCutoff: Float
	+memCutoffDisplayUnit
	+method
extra attributes are below but could they be added to wait step?
	+bufferVolume: Float -will need link to material
	+bufferVolDisplayUnit: Word
	+bufferChanges: Float

-06- Do you mean that Protocol.DialysisStep.[bufferVolume, bufferVolDisplayUnit & bufferChanges] attributes should also be added to Protocol.WaitStep?

No sorry, I don't think that is correct as they don't relate to all wait steps. 
Also, if a filtration or dialysis step involves the use of a consumable instrument, is the attribute membraneName still required here?  It will be part of the Instrument.RefInstrument class??


(2) OneShotDisruptor will be covered by the 'Protocol.PressStep'
The data model Protocols can have French Press or Sonication steps, this is an alternative cell disruption method. May need a new step if there are unique parameters to  record. Waiting for details from Scott in Dundee.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- People package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: Organisation: added attributes
- type with possible values {"home laboratory", "other laboratory", "reagent supplier", "instrument supplier", ...}

- Changed attributes
CURRENT:
name         (input box) REQUIRED
address      (textarea)

-07- Do we really want to store 4 lines for the address or a multiple line field would work?

:: Person
	+ familyName – contains mistyping in the help 
	+ familyTitle – should be a list of predefined values 
	+ title - should be a list of predefined values = {Mrs, Mr, Dr, Professor}


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Citation package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:: Citation
	+ keywords – in the help text should contain the information about which delimiters users should use. For instance keywords might be the following: Cell division;  BarT protein location; BarT function description.
	+ status – should be list of predefined values 
	+ casAbstractCode – should contain the example 
	+ medLineUiCode - should contain the example 
	+ pubMedId - should contain the example 
	+ isPrimary  - need more explanation of what it is. 

-08- Can Rasmus give us more explanation of what Citation.isPrimary is? For instance, if Peter adds citation for the Target and think that this Citation is the most important one (the primary source of information on this Target) does he need to make it isPrimary=yes? 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Taxonomy package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: split NaturalSource into 2 class:
(1) NaturalSource

Remove plasmidDetails and details. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- CONTROLLED VOCABULARY ON ENUMERATION LIST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are a number of places in the data model where the value of an attribute usually comes from a list we can pre-define. These lists of pre-defined values should be:
	- configurable locally
	- internationalisable

There are 3 options to handle them:
	- values of such lists are kept in a database table
	- values are stored in an XML file maybe it is easier for users to customize
	- they are compiled into the generated code. I don't think it can work for open enumeration. How are you going to add new values to the list?

-09- I am in favour of storing the values of such lists in the database. What do you think?
