<br />Provides abstract classes and interfaces that express the design for 
persistence in PIMS. 
<p>
This is a design for the common features required by any data model
(a "metamodel").
Design goals are:
<ul>
<li>provide an adequate API for applications</li>
<li>in particular, provide an API that will remain stable</li>
<li>not constrain implementations</li>
</ul>

<p>
A real-world laboratory object is represented by a record in the PIMS database.
Each transaction represents the database as it is at a particular moment.
That is why transactions are also referred to as "versions" of the model.
</p>
<p>
An application begins by getting an instance of AbstractModel, 
then uses the methods it provides.
The next step is to call either <code>model.getReadableVersion()</code>
 or <code>model.getWritableVersion()</code>.
This starts a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">transaction</a>. 
The application will then use the methods provided by the version
to read or update the model. 
</p>
<p>
Any changes made to the model are made permanent by calling <code>version.commit()</code>,
or cancelled by calling <code>version.abort()</code>. The application is responsible for
calling one or the other before discarding the version object.
All the changes will be made together as a single atomic update.
An example is:
<code>
        WritableVersion version = model.getWritableVersion(username);
        try {
            processRequest(version, parms);
            version.commit();
        } catch (AbortedException e) {
            //Could add code here to retry
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        } catch (ConstraintException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("The values you provided are inconsistent:", e);
        } catch (AccessException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("You are not allowed to do that:", e);
        } finally {
            if (!version.isCompleted()) {
                version.abort();
            }
        }

</code></p>
<p>
This API provides methods to query metadata about the model, 
e.g. <code>model.getMetaClass()</code>.
It also provides methods to update the model that use this metadata, e.g. 
metaRole.add(). These are used to make the generic parts of the UI.
There are also specific methods for updating the model in the generated classes.
These will be used when implementing scientific logic.
