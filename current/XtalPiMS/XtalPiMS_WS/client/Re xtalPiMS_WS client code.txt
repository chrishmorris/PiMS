Hi Chris,

Its .NET, which probably isn't quite what you were after, but its not too dissimilar to Java.

I've attached two classes.

ImagingTaskProviderNew.cs forms part of the extension DLL that RockImager loads. The 
IImagingTaskProvider.ImagingPlate method is probably most relevant to your needs, as this is the 
method that calls the imagingPlate method on the web service, which in turn creates the 
PlateInspection.

ImageUploader.cs is the vast majority of a separate app that tells PiMS about the images. At the point 
that this code runs, the images themselves have already been written to a web-served folder and the 
image details written to an xml file. This allows a local image server and remote pims, which I will do 
if/when Strubi's imagers go to pims.

Jon
