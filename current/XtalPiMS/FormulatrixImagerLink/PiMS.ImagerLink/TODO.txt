1. OPPF.Integrations.ImagerLink.Scheduling.ImagingTaskProvider and ImagingTaskProviderNew
have some hard-coded database connection strings. These should be moved to the config
file.

2. OPPF.Integrations.ImagerLink.PlateInfoProviderNew has a hard-coded list of plate types.
This was done as a temporary work-around for a mismatch between the id according to PiMS
and the id according to RockImager. Its possible that RockImager would accept the PiMS id
- Jon didn't try as it could cause RockImager's existing taught plate positions to be
lost.
