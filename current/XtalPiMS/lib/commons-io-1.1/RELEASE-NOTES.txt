			 Commons IO Package
			    Version 1.1
			   Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

Commons IO is a package of Java utility classes for java.io's hierarchy.  
Classes in this package are considered to be so standard and of such high 
reuse as to justify existence in java.io.

Commons IO contains utility classes, stream implementations, file filters, 
and endian transformation classes.


Incompatible changes from 1.0
-----------------------------
Binary compatible - Yes

Source compatible - Yes

Semantic compatible - Yes, except:
- FileUtils.writeStringToFile()
    A null encoding previously used 'ISO-8859-1', now it uses the platform default
    Generally this will make no difference

- LockableFileWriter
    Improved validation and now create directories if necesssary

plus these bug fixes may affect you semantically:
- FileUtils.touch()  (Bug fix 29821)
    Now creates the file if it did not previously exist

- FileUtils.toFile(URL) (Bug fix 32575)
    Now handles escape syntax such as %20

- FileUtils.sizeOfDirectory()  (Bug fix 36801)
    May now return a size of 0 if the directory is security restricted


Deprecations from 1.0
---------------------
- CopyUtils has been deprecated.
    Its methods have been moved to IOUtils.
    The new IOUtils methods handle nulls better, and have clearer names.

- IOUtils.toByteArray(String) - Use {@link String#getBytes()}
- IOUtils.toString(byte[]) - Use {@link String#String(byte[])}
- IOUtils.toString(byte[],String) - Use {@link String#String(byte[],String)}


Bug fixes from 1.0
------------------
- FileUtils - touch()  [29821]

    Now throw IOException with a better message

- FileUtils - writeStringToFile()
    Null encoding now correctly uses the platform default
