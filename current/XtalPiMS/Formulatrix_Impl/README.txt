A partial implementation of the xtalPiMS business API that accesses a manufacturer's database
for a crystal imager.

To adapt this for another imager, search for "TODO". 
The TODO comments are numbered, do them in order.
They show which test cases must pass.

When you have a test case failure, the cause is likely to be a statement 
that is marked with a FIXME comment.
