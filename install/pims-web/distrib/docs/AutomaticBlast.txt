You can set your PiMS installation to search the PDB
and or TargetDB on a regular basis for news relating to your targets.

1. Type
    ant -v
If the response is
    Apache Ant version 1.6.5 compiled on May 3 2006
    Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
    Build failed
then "Ant" is installed on your system.
Otherwise, you will need to install 'Ant' and set up some parameters.

    * Windows
        -Download Ant from "http://mirror.fubra.com/ftp.apache.org/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.7.0-bin.zip"   and unzip the file.

    * Linux
      check if Ant is already installed by typing: ant (on the command line)
        -if ant is not installed you will need to install the correct version for your operating system

    * Parameters:
          o Add the Ant bin directory to your path
          o Create or set the ANT_HOME Environment Variable to the directory where Ant is installed

2. You must specify some details by copying the file
    $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/pims/WebContent/WEB-INF/conf/Properties.sample
to
    $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/pims/WebContent/WEB-INF/conf/Properties
and editing it. 

3. Then you can search both databases by:

ant -f  $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/pims/WebContent/WEB-INF/build-blast.xml \
    SearchPDB SearchTargetDB 
    
4. You can then set this up as a regular job.
On Linux, this is done with the "cronjob" command.
It is better to ensure you receive the output by for example:

ant -f  $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/pims/WebContent/WEB-INF/build-blast.xml \
    SearchPDB SearchTargetDB |\
