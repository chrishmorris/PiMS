MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE OF PiMS

If the performance of your PiMS installation is unsatisfactory, then you may wish to run some of these tests to work out what exactly is slow. 
The components involved are: your client machine, the network, the database, and Tomcat.

* Visit:
     http://pimstrak1.dl.ac.uk:8080/demo/View/org.pimslims.model.experiment.ExperimentGroup:87410 
(username "demo", password "demo")
It should take around takes 6 seconds to render after a Control-F5. 
If that is what you get, the problem is not your client machine.

* Visit a plate experiment on your PiMS. How long does that take? 
If it is much longer, then there is a problem. 

* Visit a help page on your PiMS. If that is slow, the problem is not the database.


* SSH to your server, and run a script like the one below. You will need to replace the number 85294 with the dbid for the plate experiment you visited before,
and replace the username and password.

  curl -c login.curl 'http://localhost:8080/pims/Login' 1>/dev/null; sleep 1
  curl   --location  -b login.curl -e'http://localhost:8080/pims/Login' \
     -d'j_username=demo&j_password=demo' \
     'http://localhost:8080/pims/j_security_check' 1>/dev/null
  date +%s
  curl -b login.curl 'http://localhost:8080/pims/View/org.pimslims.model.experiment.ExperimentGroup:85294' 1>/dev/null 
  date +%s

If this is slow, the problem is not the network.


If you still have a problem, then please send the results of these tests to pims-defects@dl.ac.uk
