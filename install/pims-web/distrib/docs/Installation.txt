Installing PiMS
=============================

INSTRUCT provides a PiMS installation. All academic scientists in Europe are welcome to use it. 
For a userid, please contact
   pims-users@dl.ac.uk
There are more details at:
    http://pims.instruct-fp7.eu/
This is the recommended way to use PiMS.
    

If you already have a PiMS installation and want to update it, then please see
    http://pims.structuralbiology.eu/docs//README.txt
    
    
If you prefer to have your own installation of PiMS on your own server, 
then this file describes the installation procedure. First, download the release from:
    http://pims.structuralbiology.eu/pims.zip
and unzip it, for example by logging on as root and
    wget -c /root/pims.zip http://pims.structuralbiology.eu/pims.zip
    unzip pims.zip
    cd jars/
This large file contains everything you need to update PiMS 
or install PiMS for the first time.

    

PRECONDITIONS
=============

    You will need to install the following before you can run PIMS:
    - Java 1.6 JDK or above. We recommend Oracle Java, OpenJdk6 does not work because of:
           https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/show_bug.cgi?id=100251
    - Postgresql 8.1 or later
    - Tomcat7
    - GraphViz 2.18 (http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php)

Take special note of your superuser name and password
during installation of postgreSQL, it will be needed during the PIMS install.
The instructions below assume that the superuser is called "postgres".

When installing GraphViz on Windows, you should add it to the path,
so that "dot" is a valid command. Alternatively, see Windows.txt.

For GraphViz on linux (or Mac), the formats actually available in a given Graphviz 
system depends on how the system was built and the presence of additional libraries. 
To see what formats *dot* supports, run dot -T?.

You may need to recompile dot on linux for png support 
(http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/output.html). 

 
DEPLOYING IN TOMCAT
===================

    There are several ways to deploy a web app in Tomcat. The most predictable
    is to create a file:
        $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/pims.xml
    with contents like in
        http://pims.structuralbiology.eu/docs/installation/pims.xml
    If you also want to install xtalPiMS, then make a similar file xtal.xml, linking to xtalPiMS.war.

    The file should have
        <Context docBase="/root/pims4_4.war" path="/pims" xmlBlockExternal="false" >
        </Context>
    See below for the <Environment> elements that must appear in this <Context>.
    After you have prepared it, make a copy e.g.:
         $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/pims.xml.backup
    because Tomcat sometimes deletes this file.

    You are recommended to run Tomcat with the following Java options:
        -server -Xmx1024m  -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -enableassertions
    If you are running PiMs on a server with no graphics card, you also need:
        -Djava.awt.headless=true
    On Linux, you set these by
        export JAVA_OPTS="-server -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -enableassertions -Djava.awt.headless=true"

    If you have a server class machine, or are upgrading from a previous release of PiMS,
    please see Tomcat.txt for some other problems you may encounter.

    Developers should see Eclipse.txt for how to install PiMS as a development copy.


INSTALLATION OF THE PIMS DATABASE
=================================

  There are dedicated installation instructions for different platforms in other
  files at this folder. Please see which one better fits your needs.
  Below follows general instructions.

  If you are installing PiMS for the first time,
  then you need to install a database as explained here.

  This release is tested only Postgres and Oracle.
  These instructions assume you have already installed your database server but
have not created the pims database or database users.

   Create the database and database users:

        createuser -U postgres -P pimsview
        createuser -U postgres -P pimsupdate
        createuser -U postgres -P pimsadmin
        createdb -U pimsadmin --encoding UTF-8 pims

    If you used a postgres superuser name other than 'postgres', use your
    postgres superuser name in place of 'postgres' in these commands.
    You may need to add an entry to pg_hba.conf.
    See file postgresql.txt for details.

    You do not have to use 'pims' as the name of the database in the
    createdb command but if you do not, the subsequent steps will need
    adapting accordingly.

    All three users only need the default privileges - answer no the three
    questions asked by createuser (superuser, create databases and create
    roles).

    Keep a note of the passwords you specify - in particular you will need
    the password for pimsupdate in Step 4.

  Step 3. Install the data model and reference data:
        psql -d pims -U pimsadmin -f pims-database.sql

  Step 4. Load the reference data. 
       You need to provide the database connection information, in a file called Properties. 
       You can do this by editing the file conf/Properties to add the password for your database. Then:
           java -jar -Xms64m -Xmx256m RefDataLoader.jar loadRefData
           
  Step 5. Create a directory for uploaded files.
  
       So that your PiMS users can upload files, you must tell Tomcat where to put them, 
       by editing the file:
            $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/pims.xml
       for example to set:
            <Environment name="uploadDirectory" type="java.lang.String"
               value="/var/pims/pimsUploads"  />
               
        You must create this directory, and make it writeable by Tomcat:
            mkdir /var/pims
            mkdir /var/pims/pimsUploads
            chown tomcat /var/pims/pimsUploads
        
       You will want to back up this directory regularly. 

  Step 6. Configure PIMS for your database connection.

    Edit your Tomcat Context configuration file as created in "DEPLOYING IN TOMCAT":
        $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/pims.xml
    You should add Environments in this file for your database Connection.
    eg:
     <Environment name="db.className"
        value="org.postgresql.Driver" type="java.lang.String" />
    <Environment name="db.url"
        value="jdbc:postgresql://localhost/pims"  type="java.lang.String" />
    <Environment name="db.username"
        value="pimsupdate" type="java.lang.String" />
    <Environment name="db.password"
        value="abcd" type="java.lang.String"/>

    Then stop and restart Tomcat.


CONFIGURING YOUR HTTP PROXY
===========================

PiMS has a facility to download targets from public databases.
If your organisation uses an HTTP proxy then you must tell PiMS what it is.
To do this, specify proxy settings in your Tomcat Context configuration file 
as created in "DEPLOYING IN TOMCAT":
        $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/pims.xml

        http.proxyHost - your proxy server
        http.proxyPort - your proxy port
        http.nonProxyHosts - the server which should be accessed directly

    Example:
    eg:
      <Environment name="http.proxyHost"
            value="wwwcache3.dl.ac.uk" type="java.lang.String"/>
        <Environment name="http.proxyPort"
            value="8080" type="java.lang.String" />
        <Environment name="http.nonProxyHosts"
            value="localhost" type="java.lang.String" />

CONFIGURATION OF OTHER PIMS PARAMETERS
======================================
    There are some other Environment elements in the configuration file. 
    You will not usually want to change these.    


DEFINING USERS AND ACCESS RIGHTS
================================

    PiMS can now store users' passwords in its own database, except for the PiMS administrator.
    Previous versions of PiMS used the file tomcat-users.xml to record all the passwords.
    This version of PiMS can still be operated the old way - 
    if you are updating an existing installation you can ignore this section. 
    Please note that the procedure described here does not work in Tomcat6.
    
    Copy postgresql-9.1-901.jdbc3.jar to $CATALINA_HOME/lib/.

    (1) edit $CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml
    You need roles:
        <role rolename="pims-user"/>
        <role rolename="pims-administrator"/>

    You should add something like this. You can choose the user name:
        <user username="administrator" password="xxx" roles="pims-administrator,pims-user"/>
        <!-- and for each PiMS user: -->
        <user username="xxx" password="xxx" roles="pims-user"/>
    [Replace 'xxx' with the usernames/passwords you want to use to log
    into PIMS]

    You can now log on to PiMS as the administrator.

    (2) Go to
        http://localhost:8080/pims/Create/org.pimslims.model.accessControl.User
    log on as administrator, and define your first PiMS user.
    (You may need to correct the domain name, depending how you have installed PiMS)
    Click the link to create a new user, and fill in the details and click Save.
    Click "User Groups: Search".

    Click in the check box for the     "public" user group
    to add that user to the "public" Lab Notebook.     
    A Lab Notebook is a group of PiMS pages. Also click the link to "Change Password". 
    Once you have set a password, the new user can log in to PiMS.
    Advise her or him to change the password - there is a menu entry 
    under the word "Logout" on the menu bar.

    

    (3) If you are happy to have all your data in a single public project,
    no more action is needed. Otherwise go to
        http://localhost:8080/pims/access/Permission
    and click the link "Create new project". You can use the edit permissions
    page to fine tune the permissions for your user groups. Then you can
    add your users to the user groups appropriate to the projects
    they are involved with. The list of users you have set up is at
        http://localhost:8080/pims/Search/org.pimslims.model.accessControl.User

    The notes on
        http://localhost:8080/pims/access/Permission
    explains the options you have for access control.



INSTALLATION PROBLEMS
=====================

    If you are updating from an earlier version of PiMS, some pages may be laid out incorrectly
    when first viewed. If any users complain about this, please asked them
    to press CONTROL-F5.

    If you encounter a problem installing PIMS on a particular platform,
    you may find some hints in:
        http://pims.structuralbiology.eu/docs/
    If you have hints about how to install on your preferred platform,
    we would be pleased to receive details.
