PiMS-Backup is an application to create a copy of the PiMS database for a
specific user and doing so, respecting the access rights this user may have,
i.e., for the stuff that the user doesn't have access, they will be removed from
the final sql file created.

The main idea is to allow an user to load this private sql file in his/her own
computer and have access to PiMS offline and just for reading purposes.

This application can only be run by the PiMS administrator.

Files needed to run pims-backup
    - build.xml (ant script)
    - filterdb.jar (java binary)
    - conf/Properties (folder and properties file)
    - log/ (folder where logs will be written)

The tgz file pims-backup.tgz contains the files above.

Before using, the PiMS administrator may need to modify file 'conf/Properties'
properly.

To use, just do in pims-backup folder the command:

    ant -DanUser=_user_ [-Dforce=yes] makedbbackup

where _user_ is the user name for whom the administrator wants a copy/backup.

Option "-Dforce=yes" is case one is using a old version of DB and the usual
command is failing.
