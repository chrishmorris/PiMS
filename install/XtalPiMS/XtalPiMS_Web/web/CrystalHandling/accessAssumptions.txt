Some notes on how the access rights work around crystal handling.

In Oulu, we import images from the Formulatrix robots without importing either 
conditions or ownership data.

A user "formulatrix" is the owner of all plates, recording them into a 
"Formulatrix" lab notebook. This user has full (CRUD) permissions on this LN,
and no permissions on any other.

We have a user "fxview" who has read-only permission on the "Formulatrix" LN; 
this means that anyone with the password can view all crystallization images 
from our imagers without needing a PiMS account.

This is OK; there is no information about conditions, and the images are all 
but useless on their own.

However, crystallization conditions can be recorded at the crystal treatment
stage. The selection and subsequent treatments may also be confidential.

"fxview" should clearly be locked out of the treatment UI. He can't do anything
and has no business being there.

The crystal treatment page assumes that nobody without Create permissions in at
least one LN should have access to crystal treatment. Such users (including 
"fxview" are prevented even from entering the module.

Anyone with create permissions in at least one LN can enter the crystal 
treatment module. The existing permissions system then ensures that he sees 
only the selections and treatments he should know about. Users within the same
(lab) group might have read permission on each other's treatments; the PiMS
permission system ensures that they can't modify them.

It's theoretically possible that two users could select the same crystal 
through the PiMS UI and record an entire treatment chain under it, both 
blissfully unaware of the other's actions because their permissions don't allow
them to see each other's work. In practice, though, the real-world physical 
constraint of having only one plate, owned by one of them but not the
other, should prevent this situation from occurring.
