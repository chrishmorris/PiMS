### Need further discussions - after 1.0
- change role Target.protein to unchangeable: no otherwise setProtein() does not exist if link unchangeable.

- PIMS-258: replace all Target name attributes: commonName, systematicName, localName by name?
     - remove serial
     - remove commonName, systematicName and localName
     - remove proteinName
     - replace commonName by name and make it a unique key: Uniprot entry name, e.g. CAIC_ECOLI
     - add attr aliases: list of other names

commonName 1..1 The common name of the target is the name used to identify the target e.g. 'Endonuclease IV'.
systematicName 0..1 The systematic name of the target is the 'proper' scientific name e.g. 'Endodeoxyribonuclease IV'.
localName 0..1 Local name is what the target is known as in the lab e.g. 'A6'.

geneName 0..1 The official name of the gene for this target. e.g. 'fcy1'.

proteinName 0..1 The official name of the protein for this target. By default: 'theoretical protein'. e.g. 'Cytosine deaminase'.
protein.name 1..1 The name of the MolComponent used to describe the Target protein

replaced by

name 1..1 The name of the target used to uniquely identify the target. It is its uniprot entry name, e.g. CAIC_ECOLI.
aliases 0..* The list of the other target names: localName, proteinName,...

geneName 0..1 The official name of the gene for this target. e.g. 'fcy1'.
