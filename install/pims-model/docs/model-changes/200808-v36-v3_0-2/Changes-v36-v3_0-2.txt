PiMS RELEASE v3.0-2
DATABASE REVISION NUMBER 36.
PURPOSE: Changes related to re-design work
================================================================================

Package.
- rename implementation to core & rename tables IMPL_XXX to CORE_XXX
- rm ApplicationData & subclasses
- rm ContentStored, DataLocation, Storage, NormalStorage, ContentStorage
- rm AbstractStorage & Project
- rm all project property in subclasses of BaseClass
- rm Url

BaseClass.
- rename MemopsBaseClass to BaseClass & rename MEMOPSBASECLASSID to BASECLASSID & rename CORE_MEMOPSBASECLASS to CORE_BASECLASS & remove memops everywhere else
- add property details in BaseClass and remove it from all subclasses

LabBookEntry.
- create LabBookEntry in core
- change extends BaseClass to LabBookEntry for most of the classes (except future reference classes)
- add link between User & LabBookEntry called author & add creationDate
- add link between User & LabBookEntry called lastEditor & add lastEditedDate
- rm links Experiment.creator, Protocol.creator, DropAnnotation.annotator, Image.creator, Target.creator
- rm Protocol.lastEditor, Protocol.lastEditedDate, Experiment.lastEditor, Experiment.lastEditedDate

Attachment.
- create Attachment with date and author property as subclass of BaseClass
- add one-to-many parent link between LabBookEntry and Attachment.

Annotation.
- mv Annotation to core - extends Attachment & remove pkg annotation
- rm Annotation.date & Annotation.author
- rm Annotation links to ExperimentGroup, Experiment, TargetGroup, TargetProject, Target, Protocol. Replaced by link to LabBookEntry

DbRef.
- mv DbRef to core and rename to ExternalDbLink - extends Attachment
- rm ExternalDbLink links to TargetGroup, Target. Replaced by link to LabBookEntry

Note.
- create Note class with relatedEnties link to LabBookEntry - extends Attachment

Citation.
- mv Citation to core & subclasses - extends Attachment
- rm Citation links to Person (change to String), Method, Protocol, Software, Target. Replace by link to LabBookEntry
- rm in Citation attr casAbstractCode, doi, medlineUiCode, pubMedId.
- rm Citation.keywords

LabBookEntry.
- add extra methods in LabBookEntry for getAnnotations(), getNotes(), getCitations() & getExternalDbLinks()

Primer.
- add extra property in Primer [meltingTemperatureGene, meltingTemperatureSeller, gcGene, lengthOnGene, opticalDensity, particularity, restrictionSite]

Annotation.
- change column definition of description to TEXT in order to be able to store legend of image with line breaks.

Reference changes.
- create package reference
- mv DbName to reference
- mv HolderCategory, InstrumentType, ComponentCategory, ExperimentType, WorkflowItem, HazardPhrase, SampleCategory, Scoreboard, Status, NaturalSource, AbstractHolderType, PinType, HolderType, CrystalType into reference
- rename NaturalSource to Organism
- rename Status to TargetStatus
- create PublicEntry in reference
- change prefix of table names to REF_
- rm unique key namingSystem in subclasses of PublicEntry (keep name in subclasses otherwise problem with unique key)
- refactor Organism.organismName to .name
- rm namingSystem attribute (not normalised) in reference package and put getter/setter @Deprecated
- make one-to-many links to reference classes only one way (no need to getSamples from SampleCategory)
- rm dbRef, riskAssessment, taxonomy packages

- rm description field in AccessObject, Annotation & SchedulePlan

Annotation.
- add mimeType attribute
- add title & legend attribute

Access.
- mv AccessObject link from BaseClass to LabBookEntry

Reference.
- rm Scoreboard

Other changes.
- mv Instrument to experiment
- mv Method to experiment
- rename package refSampleComponent to Molecule
- rename MolCompFeature into MoleculeFeature
- rm in protocol pkg Procedure, Step, WaitStep, TemperatureStep
- merge target & expBlueprint packages
- rename TargetProject into Project
- rename ExpBlueprint into ResearchObjective

Bug Fixes
- PIMS-2039 ExpBlueprint.whyChosen should be optional
>>> change not-null="true" to not-null="false" for expBlueprint.ExpBlueprint.whyChosen

Experiment pkg
- PIMS-1278 Separate parameters to two categories - Setup parameters + Result parameters
>>> add extra attribute isResult in ParameterDefinition
>>> add helper methods getResultParameters() and getSetupParameters() by a search, using the value of isResult
>>> (later) add another link between ParameterDefinition and Parameter, rename existing one to setupParameters and called the new one resultParameters

Protocol Constraints
- PIMS-1876 Protocol editor allow duplication of input and output samples. Such protocol, if made, cannot be used for making new experiments.
>>> add uniqueness constraint on RefInputSample and RefOutputSample (protocolId, name)

Target link to Status
- PIMS-385 The links of ccp.Target.Status are called 'code'
>>> rename the link called code to status between Milestone and Status in target package
- PIMS-419 the role status(code) for targetStatus should be unchangeable
>>> check that the role from Milestone to Status is unchangeable

Target pkg
- PIMS-1030 in simple experiment, once the milestone is added to a construct/target, it is always linked to this construct
>>> remove link between Milestone and ExpBlueprint and create an helper method getMilestones in ExpBlueprint

Holder pkg
- PIMS-386 ccp.Holder.HolderCategories
>>> links AbstractHolder/HolderCategory and AbstractHolderType/HolderCategory should not be mandatory
>>> rename link AbstractHolderType/HolderCategory to defaultHolderCategories

ApplicationData
- put back with modifications
- merge all subclasses of ApplicationData into ApplicationData: ApplicationData extends Attachment with attributes {application: String, keyword: String, value: String, type: String}

Reference
- mark problem many-to-many methods as deprecated

Protocol
- create helper methods based on ParameterDefinition.isResult() in Protocol getResultParamDefinitions() and getSetupParamDefinitions()
- remove links called setupDefinitions and resultDefinitions
