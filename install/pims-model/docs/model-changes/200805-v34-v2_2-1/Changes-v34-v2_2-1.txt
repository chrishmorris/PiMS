DATA MODEL CHANGES 34
Small changes from issue tracker (not involving roles)
================================================================================
DM Changes Agreed - Anne (implemented revision 14610)
================================================================================
x PIMS-1653 DbRef.code has limitation of 32 characters which is not sufficient to record some databases accessions
>>> change data type from VARCHAR(32) to VARCHAR(80) for dbRef.DbRef.code

x PIMS-1662 DM-level date/time
>>> replace java.sql.Timestamp into java.util.Calendar to be able to add a timezone 
>>> add timezone into timestamp in 42 places e.g. annotation.Annotation.date become annotation.Annotation.calendar
>>> 21 matches in mapping files: Annotation; ConferenceCitation; DropAnnotation; 
    Image; Experiment; ExperimentGroup; Holder; HolderLocation; PersonInGroup; Protocol
    Sample; Milestone; Project

x PIMS-1840 The person/creator of crystallization.Image should be nullable
>>> change not-null="true" to not-null="false" for crystallization.Image.creator

x PIMS-1996 the "why chosen" of target should not be mandatory
>>> change not-null="true" to not-null="false" for target.Target.whyChosen

x PIMS-1512 Experiment Status
>>> add value "unknown" into the list of possible values of Experiment.experiment.status
--> TODO: use null for unspecified in db and change getter to return empty string when null

x PIMS-389 Reagent shelf life
>>> add attribute useByDate into class sample.Sample of type Calendar

x PIMS-1441 Constraint needed that start date is before end date
>>> add constraint end_date_ge_start_date (ge = greater than or equals to) on experiment.Experiment.endDate

x replace meta attribute contraints by constraints

================================================================================
Code Changes Agreed - Bill
================================================================================
x PIMS-1980 Improve performance by indexing foreign key relationships
- PIMS-450 Convenience methods for ModelObject
- PIMS-1116 seperate upgrader from DM project
x PIMS-1687 Duplicates of sample components are displayed in ChooseForCreate search results when 'search in all fields' is used

================================================================================
Deferred - still under discussion
================================================================================
- PIMS-1417 Experiment.protocol should be required (2.2)
>>> change not-null="false" to not-null="true" for experiment.Experiment.protocol
look @ email discussion

- PIMS-1559 Remove links to admin-only pages (2.2)
>>> Need some more thought on reference data
>>> Distinction can be made based on table populated or not when install PiMS e.g. chemical data
>>> If reference data + referenced, should not be editable because has history data linked to it

- PIMS-1956 the behaviours of hibernate cache should be reviewed (4.0)
>>> 2 levels of cache - no performance problem is labPiMS
>>> need to see the benefits because sometimes more troubles - get test setup to see the performance (Bill)

- PIMS-536 MetaAttribute.getConstraint does not report uniqueness constraints (4.0)
>>> need change in generation template

- PIMS-571 role should have an bollean attribute to tell the access right should be check or not (3.0)
>>> clear example needed e.g. link to AccessObject- Bill to provide
