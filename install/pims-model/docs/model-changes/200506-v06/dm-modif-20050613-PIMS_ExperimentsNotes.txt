Problems:
-endDate is mandatory –can’t use status ‘In process’
-no ‘Dialysis’ experiment
- is link attribute ‘Method’ for instruments?
what is sampleIos –deprecated??




Example for a PCR Experiment
use Mark Fogg’s example

Input samples need to be defined as reagents
Output samples as ‘samples’
?ExpBlueprint?

An experiment is defined by a protocol
How do we record a protocol in PIMS???
PCR protocol Mark Fogg’s using KOD HS Polymerase
PCR primers resuspended at 100 pmol/μl (100μM) stocks.  Dilute 1:5 for 20μM working dilution

total volume 50 μl

input samples: samples in bold are specific to this protocol
NB.  all of these will need to be defined as reagents
-Template DNA (50ng/μl)	~1μl (depends on source/genome size, cDNA)
-PCR primer –sense		1μl (0.4μM in 50 μl reaction)
-PCR primer –antisense	1μl (0.4μM in 50 μl reaction)
-dNTPs				5μl (Novagen, typically 2mM stock of
					all 4 dNTPs in mix i.e. each dNTP is
					at 2mM.  Final concentration is 200uM)
-Polymerase			1μl (1U/ul Novagen Hot start KOD)
-MgSO4				2μl (25mM stock Novagen, final conc.
					1mM, this is variable)
-10x PCR buffer		5μl (200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 80 mM
					MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 500 mg/ml BSA)
-H2O					50 – 15.5 μl (volume varies), sterile
					 deionised? water

Protocol will have 5 procedures each with a number of steps:
Procedure 1 = setting up, 1 cycle, 6 steps (adding components)
Procedure 2 = initial denaturation, 1 cycle, 2 steps (temperature and wait)
Procedure 3 = thermocycling, 35 cycles, 6 steps (temperature, wait, temperature, wait, temperature and wait)
Procedure 4 = final extension, 1 cycle 1 steps (wait)
Procedure 5 = hold, 1 cycle, 2 steps (temperature and wait)
